# About the scripts

The main script to analyse the data and generate the figures for publication is `DA_qad_DI_analysis.m`. The other scripts are support scripts, some of which are called by the main script. The data were originally saved as tab-separated value text files where the first, second and third columns represeted the trial number, stimulated digit ID and reported digit ID; the data arrays were saved to .mat files for further analysis. 

All scripts were written solely by *me* between 2012 - 2015.
